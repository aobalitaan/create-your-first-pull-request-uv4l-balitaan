My expectations for CMSC 100, are to learn how to use the MERN stack effectively and efficiently. I hope to create dynamic and interactive websites and web applications that can solve real-world problems and enhance my skills as a programmer. I also expect to follow the web development best practices, such as writing clear and concise code, documenting my work, ensuring accessibility and usability, and testing my code on different platforms and browsers.
